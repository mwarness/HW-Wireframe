                    <article>Im 31 years old and new to the tech world all together. Originally from north Jersey, I migrated to the great city of Philly back in 2012. I have previously worked in the medical field, the gaming industry, hospitality, construction, and lastly interior design. Jack of all trades!

                     <article>I have always been the creative type, but creativity with absolute freedom (like in the arts) is extremely overwhelming for me! I like the idea of being able to create something but within a framework and with structure.</article>

                                <p>I want to create things that are asthetically beautiful as they are functional. Whether that be an app, webpage, or a start up is yet to be determined.</p>
